# HackBrea
HackBrea is an upcoming hackathon specifically crafted for high school students, taking place in Brea, California. It's goal is to introduce high schoolers to the amazing world of hacking by bringing highly skilled developers together with high school students with a wide range of experience from having never written a line of code in their life to having a large portfolio of projects. 

This is the main repo for HackBrea planning.

## F.A.Q.
### So why is there a repo for HackBrea?
We wanted to make the planning of HackBrea an open source adventure, that anyone and everyone can participate in.  The hope is that anyone interested would spend some time and help improve upon our plans and designs for HackBrea.

We also wanted to make all of our planning available to future hackathon, in hopes that they might be able to build off of what we created, and make something even better!

### This is really cool! How can I help?
We are in need of volunteers to mentor students and/or assist in crowd control. If you are interested in helping us out, you can sign up at http://hackbrea.com/?volunteer.

Along with all of that, if you want to help us plan the event, feel free to make changes to our plans, or add new parts entirely! You can do this by cloning this repo (or any of the sub-repos), making your changes, and then creating a pull request against our repo.

### Are you looking for sponsors?
Absolutely! If you're in a position to sponsor our hackathon, we would love to hear from you! You can get in contact with us via our website: http://hackbrea.com/?sponsor.

## Specific help
### A new logo
Neither Josh or Louis are artists, and as such, the current logo is really just a placeholder. A new logo would be a great help!
### Sponsorship contacts
We believe that HackBrea is a great venue for sponsorship because of the range of experience that will be in attendance. Sponsors will have the opportunity to teach hackers who are just starting to learn about programming, using their products as a learning platform and potentially making customers for life.
